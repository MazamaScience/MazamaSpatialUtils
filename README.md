# MazamaSpatialUtils

This R package contains a suite of conversion scripts to create internally standardized
spatial polygons dataframes. Utility scripts use these datasets to return
values such as country, state, timezone, watershed, etc. associated with a
set of longitude/latitude pairs. (They also make cool maps.)
