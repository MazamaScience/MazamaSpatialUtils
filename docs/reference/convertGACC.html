    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>A GACC shapefile is downloaded and converted to a
simple features data frame with additional columns of data. The resulting
file will be created in the spatial data directory which is set with
<code><a href="setSpatialDataDir.html">setSpatialDataDir()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The source data is from 2020.</p>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>From the source documentation:</p>
<p>Although the primary mission of the GACC is logistical coordination, the
Center also has support programs in Predictive Services, Intelligence, and in
several Center's Fire Information. Predictive Services consists primarily of
professional meteorologists who monitor weather and fuel conditions, conduct
briefings, produce fire weather related products, liaison with the National
Weather Service, and oversee all aspects of the Remote Automated Weather
System (RAWS). The Intelligence Section is primarily responsible for
collecting and disseminating wildland fire and prescribed fire activity
information, monitoring the status of national firefighting resources,
maintaining year-to-date and historical fire occurrence data, and managing
the Sit Report and ICS-209 programs.</p>
<p>In some GACCs, the Predictive Services and Intelligence sections work as one
unit called the Predictive Services Group. The Predictive Services and
Intelligence Sections, whether separated or combined, work collaboratively
producing Weekly, Monthly, and Seasonal Fire Weather/Fire Danger Outlooks.
Each Coordination Center provides additional support to their respective
geographic area's wildland fire community through training, workshops,
special projects, and other tasks. Except for dispatch of air tankers and
lead planes based outside the dispatch center responsibility the fire is
located in, the GACC does not have initial-attack dispatch responsibilities.
The United States and Alaska are divided into 11 Geographic Areas for the
purpose of incident management and mobilization of resources (people,
aircraft, ground equipment). Within each Area, an interagency Geographic Area
Coordinating Group (GACG), made up of Fire Directors from each of the Federal
and State land management agencies from within the Area, is established.</p>
<p>Working collaboratively, the GACG's mission is to provide leadership and
support not only for wildland fire emergencies, but to other emergency
incidents (i.e. earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc), as
necessary. Authority for establishment of the GACG is through departmental
policy and interagency agreements. Additional agreements are established with
cooperators and other organizations in order to facilitate efficient fire
management activities within and adjacent to the Area. A cost-effective
sharing of resources among public agencies is a key component of the GACG
mission and is expected by the public, Congress, and States. All agencies and
geographic areas work together under the auspices and direction of the
National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The Geographic Area Coordination
Centers (GACC) is a result of an interagency agreement established by the
respective Geographic Area Coordinating Group. The primary mission of the
GACC is to serve Federal and State wildland fire agencies through logistical
coordination and mobilization of resources (people, aircraft, ground
equipment) throughout the geographical area, and with other geographic areas,
as necessary. This is generally done through coordinating the movement of
resources between the many Dispatch Centers within the geographic area and,
as necessary, with the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) when
resources are unavailable within the Area or when mobilization support is
needed in other geographic areas. As you survey each GACC website, it will
become obvious they are technical in design and are primarily for use by
local and geographic area wildland fire managers and firefighters. For the
general public, the GACC website may not meet your needs. If this is the case,
please check out the National Fire News website, provided by the National
Interagency Fire Center, and the InciWeb website, provided as a guide to
large fire incidents throughout the United States.</p>
