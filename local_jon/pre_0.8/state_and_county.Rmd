Merging with dataset: California-Focused
```{r}
#Note to myself: First time making a choropleth plot! What is it? Thematic maps that are used to represent statistical data through various shading patterns. 

# Testing base maps

# head(USCensusStates@data)

USCensusStates %>% 
  subset(stateCode == "CA") %>% 
  plot()

USCensusCounties %>% 
  subset(stateCode == "CA") %>% 
  plot()

# Would be more interesting if I just merge the data!
california <- USCensusCounties %>% 
  subset(stateCode == "CA") #let's use countyname

# How many counties are there in CA? There should be 58
unique(california@data$countyName) #checks out 

# Let's highlight Los Angeles County and see
USCensusCounties %>% 
  subset(countyName == "Los Angeles") %>% 
  plot()

# Fun fact: There are two islands in LA County: Catalina Island (great for diving) and San Clemente Island.

# Simplified map (1%) should make the islands disappear
USCensusCounties_01 %>% 
  subset(countyName == "Los Angeles") %>% 
  plot()

# Note: Line graphs would be great, especially for the total count confirmed and total count deaths! 

# Use dplyr left_join to merge data onto SFDF. Create a choropleth plot. Update: When using that, it turned it into a data frame. Let's try merge.

# Last time I checked, there are 88 cities in LA County. Must be duplicates. Odd, why are there missing cities? Ahh, turns out when I filtered by "LA County," some of the places were NA. Let's filter it by removing all the cities without a city number "0" and then remove the duplicates!

# Some of the cities are "missing" <- let's fill them in tomorrow and figure out why they're not! 

# Map 

# http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/ Should be similar



# Note: Going to have to stop now. When I used sp:merge, I am left with the specific cities in the LA County (la_SFDF, cities). When printed, you don't see the "LA County" shape. Messed around a little bit with the la_SFDF filter and when I plotted, it looked like what I want. Full_joined with the cities df but dimensions were not matching. Maybe I need to fill the NA's? Will come back to this.

Work in progress, not even remotely done. Definitely really like tmap but I still have a lot to embrace when it cmoes to shape files and the different layers! It's kind of similar to ggplot though, so that's nice! Definitely could have gotten more done but I had many questions along the way. This is so so fun!
