Spatial Data Sets Available in MazamaSpatialUtils
=======================================

**MazamaSpatialUtils** has three built-in datasets which are included with the package when it is installed.

* `SimpleCountries` -- country outlines
* `SimpleCountriesEEZ` -- country outlines including Exclusive Economic Zones over water
* `SimpleTimezones` -- timezones

Running `installSpatialData()` will install the following core datasets, which can then be loaded by running `loadSpatialData(<dataset>)`

 * `EEZCountries` -- country boundaries including Exclusive Economic Zones
 * `NaturalEarthAdm1` -- state/province/oblast level boundaries
 * `OSMTimezones` -- Open Street Map high resolution time zones
 * `OSMTimezones_05` -- low resolution Open Street Map time zones suitable for small-scale maps
 * `TMWorldBorders` -- high resolution country level boundaries
 * `TerrestrialEcoregions` -- terrestrial eco-regions
 * `TerrestrialEcoregions_05` -- low resolution terrestrial eco-regions suitable for small-scale maps
 * `USCensus115thCongress` -- US congressional districts
 * `USCensusCounties` -- US county level boundaries
 * `USCensusStates` -- US state level boundaries
 * `USIndianLands` -- US tribal boundaries
 * `WorldTimezones` -- high resolution timezones

Additional datasets are available via the use of specific `convert<dataset>()` functions.  These are listed below.

#### CA_AirBasins:
Use `convertCARBAirBasins()` to download and convert this dataset.

The California Air Basins layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the 15 California air basins.  Air Basins are designated pursuant to California statute and regulation and identify regions of similar meteorological and geographic conditions.  Political boundaries are also considered in determining the air basin boundaries.  _See the California Health and Safety Code, Section 39606 et seq. and California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 60100 et seq._

#### EPARegions
Use `convertEPARegions()` to download and convert this dataset.

The EPARegions layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the boundaries of the ten Regional Offices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. Each regional office monitors the environmental regulations within a group of states.

#### GACC
Use `convertGACC()` to download and convert this dataset.

The GACC layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the Geographic Area Coordination Center (GACC) boundaries.  GACCs are defined as, "The physical location of an interagency, regional operation center for the effective coordination, mobilization and demobilization of emergency management resources."  A coordination center serves federal, state and local wildland fire agencies through logistical coordination of resources throughout the geographic area, and with other geographic areas, as well.

The United States and Alaska are divided into 11 Geographic Areas for the purpose of incident management and mobilization of resources (people, aircraft, ground equipment). Within each Area, an interagency Geographic Area Coordinating Group (GACG), made up of Fire Directors from each of the Federal and State land management agencies from within the Area, is established.

(NOTE: the current geojson download link seems to be dead.  A new, shapefile based, link to the data is https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7dc5f4a286bd47e0aaafa0ab05302fe9_0.zip)

#### GADM
Use `convertGADM()` to download and convert this dataset.

The GADM layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the administrative divisions of a specific country at a specific administrative level.  GADM, the _Database of Global Administrative Areas_, is a high-resolution database of country administrative areas.

**NOTE:** This script will generate .RData files named `GADM_<countryCode>_<admLevel>.RData` and requires user input to specify the country and admin level desired.  For example, to generate Admin 1 level boundaries for Belgium, run `convertGADM(countryCode = "BE", admLevel = 1`.  This will create `GADM_BE_1.RData`. Not all countries have the same number of levels. Many just have two levels while France has five.

#### HIFLDFederalLands
Use `convertHIFLDFederalLands()` to download and convert this dataset.

The HIFLDFederalLands layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the federally owned or administered lands and Indian Reservations of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Only areas of 640 acres or more are included in this dataset.

#### HMSSmoke
Use `convertHMSSmoke()` to download and convert this dataset.

The HMSSmoke layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing the areas of smoke identified for a specific day.  This data is derived from analysis of visible satellite imagery obtained during daylight hours.

**NOTE:** This script will generate .RData files named `HMSSmoke_<datestamp>` and requires user input to specify the date of interest using the `datestamp` parameter in the format of `datestamp = "YYYYmmdd"`.

#### MTBSBurnAreas
Use `convertMTBSBurnArea()` to download and convert this datset.

The MTBSBurnAreas layer is a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` representing all large wildland fires (includes wildfire, wildland fire use, and prescribed fire) in the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico for the period of 1984 through 2017.  All fires reported as greater than 1,000 acres in the western U.S. and greater than 500 acres in the eastern U.S. are mapped across all ownerships.
